     <h1>Is it possible to travel the world without using money ?</h1>

     <h3> Since 4th January 2021, I am travelling continuously to various different places of our beautiful world.  <br><br>
        
        I did trekking across many forts and mountains in Maharashtra and later hitchhiked to Nepal and came to India to know my own country better. I visited 28 states and 6 Union Territories of India without using any money.<br><br>
        
        Travelling without using money concept really triggers lots of people. Few think its impossible, few think its unethical, few think it spoils the society and sets a bad example while few think it kills the tourism industry and becomes a problem for locals too. Few people also because of their capitalist mentality see this concept as a heinous crime and they think the world shouldn't work this way.<br><br>
        
        Money is a tool but not the only tool. We can always barter our skills and hardwork to travel, earn food and accommodation.<br><br>
        
        To understand this concept and to understand the mentality of people who are practicing it, one needs to be a little accepting and should see the world with a little love.<br><br>
        
        To introduce myself, I was born near Ayodhya in a traditional family which taught me about many great things of life and how one must lead it. I was later raised in a fast paced city called Mumbai to participate in the race of competitions. I however kept the balance of both and worked as a Journalist for a good time.<br><br>
        
        I felt my energy is too high to be just interviewing celebrities and hence I started to find time for cycling, running, swimming and trekking in Maharashtra. I wanted to know about myself and the reason for my existence on this planet. <br><br>
        
        I once wanted to Hitchhike to trek towards Kalsubai peak, but the truck driver told me that he is going to Kolkata and asked me to join. ( I wasn't prepared at all, but I saw that as an opportunity ). I worked as a Khalasi ( Helper of the truck ) In return, he not just took me 2100 kilometers away but also fed me during this journey.<br><br>
        
        After experiencing the beautiful and vibrant state of West Bengal, I moved my journey towards Nepal and learnt numerous of wonderful facts, history and about dharma. I started feeling like a traveller and I felt that now I am ready to travel the whole world.<br><br>
        
        To start, I felt I should first visit and know my country better. So I began to travel from one state to another. I have been a minimalist and an alpanist. Hence I barely need anything to survive and keep moving.<br><br>
        
        To walk for miles, needs no money but courage, dedication and endurance. To take lifts from people who are going with a vacant seat is no harm, it won't cost them even a penny extra. People are happy sharing love. <br><br>
        
        To sleep anywhere on the mother earth with own basic bedding ( A yoga mat or max a camping tent ) is no disturbance for anybody. A lot of people hosted me knowing that they would get to learn about my unique experiences.<br><br>
        
        I have also volunteered to understand this beautiful life of so much possibilities. I see this world as a family and they too love me likewise.<br><br>
        
        People while they witness me walking, out of curiosity wants to know about me, my journey and my motivate. ( I don't have to even tell them that I am traveling without money ) as a gesture of hospitality they offer tea, breakfast and even meals sometimes with deep love and support in their hearts for a traveller. I have received uncountable invitations from locals to rest at their places while my journey. I in return used to help them with the house hold chores, farming, cattle feeding and many other big and small things to make my presence worthy and meaningful.<br><br>
        
        Everybody works to earn, some earn money, some earn experiences. I have taken up the courage to sacrifice many things for this travel with a much greater cause to seek knowledge about so many different aspects of life.<br><br>
        
        I have bought very less things for myself. I think,  the things we own, endup owning us.<br><br>
        
        My consumption is so less, that I can earn them while working a day and keep moving ahead in my journey towards exploring the world.<br><br>
        
        We were born with nothing, will die with nothing. So I think, we are sent on the earth on a tourist visa and not on some work visa that we are earning the whole week and barely even leading lives even on the weekends as we need sleep. Understand life.<br><br>
        
        Be curious, be creative.<br> 
        Above all, be respectful to whatever anybody chooses to do in life, try to encourage people if you can, if they according to you is wrong, let them be themselves, don't try to make them what you are. <br><br>
        
        Not everybody wants to be a king. Great kings like Lord Rama and Lord Gautam Buddha left everything and showed the world how life is to be lead.</h3>  </p>
