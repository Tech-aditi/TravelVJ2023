     <h3> Let's pay attention on few very important decisions we make in our lives.<br>
        
        Are we just earning to pay interior designers, builders, caterers and decorators ?  <br>
        Whom do we want to impress with our highly inflated house properties & fat weddings ?<br><br>
        
        Relationships these days are unpredictable, it used to someday end with our lives but now its seen ending in the court rooms.<br><br>
        
        We don't own properties, we just have temporary name on documents.
        GOD laughs sarcastically, when someone says,
        "I am the owner of this land" !<br><br>
        
        Why are we working like dogs and cats in our prime years of life ?
        How many generations do we want to feed ?
        How much is the "need" and how much do we actually "want" ?
        Think about it.<br><br>
        
        Would our next generation be incapable to earn, that we save so much for them ?
        Can not we spare atleast one day a week for friends, family and self ?
        Do you spend even 5% of your monthly income for your self enjoyment ? 
        Usually...No.<br><br>
        
        Why can't we enjoy simultaneously while we earn ?   
        Spare time to enjoy before you have slipped discs and cholesterol blocks in your heart !<br><br>
        
        Do not judge a person only by the length of his car. <br>
        Many of our science and maths teachers were great personalities riding on scooters !<br>
        It is not bad to be rich, but it is very unfair, to be only rich.<br><br>
        
        Let's get a LIFE, before life gets us, instead....<br>
        Better late then never, get up and start exploring this beautiful world.<br>
        Life is short and the world is big.<br>
        You will take nothing but just these experiences along when you are gone.</h3>  </p>
